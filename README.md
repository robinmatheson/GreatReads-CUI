## GreatReads

GreatReads is an application that users can use to keep track of
the books in their library. Users will be able to add a book with relevant 
info about each book, including but not limited to a reading status and star 
rating. Anybody who reads can use the application. I love to read, and keeping
track of all of my books that I have read or want to read is very useful.

Please note that some functionality of this project is not implemented at this stage in order to 
simplify my GUI.
